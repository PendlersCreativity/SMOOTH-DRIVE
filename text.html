### Custom Domain Setup Guide

#### ▸ Buying a Domain
You can purchase a domain name such as `smooveride.com` from any domain registrar like:
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com)
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com)

#### ▸ Connecting Domain to Vercel
1. Log in to your Vercel account.
2. Go to the **Domains** section.
3. Click **Add Domain** and type your domain name (e.g., `smooveride.com`).
4. Copy the DNS records that Vercel provides.
5. Go to your domain registrar (e.g., Namecheap) and open DNS settings.
6. Add the provided DNS records:
   - Type: `A` or `CNAME`
   - Name: `@` or your subdomain (e.g., `www`)
   - Value: the Vercel IP or URL provided.
7. Wait a few minutes for propagation (can take up to 24 hours).
8. Once verified, your domain will be connected to your Vercel-hosted SMOOVE RIDE app.

#### ▸ Connecting Domain to Netlify
1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to your site’s **Domain Settings**.
2. Click **Add Custom Domain** and enter `smooveride.com`.
3. Follow the prompts to verify ownership.
4. Netlify will give you DNS records to add to your domain registrar.
5. After propagation, your domain will be live.

#### ▸ SSL Certificate Setup (HTTPS)
Both **Vercel** and **Netlify** automatically issue and renew free SSL certificates through **Let’s Encrypt**, ensuring your domain uses HTTPS.

If you are using a custom server:
1. Install [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).
2. Run the following (for Nginx example):
   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d smooveride.com -d www.smooveride.com
   ```
3. Certbot will automatically configure and enable HTTPS.

Your site will now be securely accessible at **https://smooveride.com**.

### DNS Record Template
Below is a ready-to-use DNS template you can copy and paste into your registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains):

| Type  | Host/Name | Value/Points To                | TTL     | Purpose               |
|-------|------------|--------------------------------|----------|------------------------|
| A     | @          | 76.76.21.21                   | Automatic | Vercel root domain    |
| CNAME | www        | cname.vercel-dns.com           | Automatic | Redirect to Vercel app|
| TXT   | _vercel    | (optional verification token) | Automatic | Domain verification   |
| TXT   | _netlify   | (optional verification token) | Automatic | For Netlify setup     |

✅ **Tip:** If you use **Netlify**, replace the `A` record with the one Netlify provides (often similar to `104.198.14.52`).

After adding these records, wait for propagation (from 10 minutes to 24 hours). Once verified, your domain will go live automatically.
